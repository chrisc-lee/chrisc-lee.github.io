Requirements:
(a) You have to use real time to synchronize your animations. (2 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. I used real time for all animation synchronization.
(b) Ground box, 2 (Marks).
I have implemented this feature. I created a black ground box.
(c) Two rocks (spheres), (4 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. I created 2 rocks 1 small and 1 larger.
(d) Seaweed modeling: each strand has 10 ellipses. (4 Marks)
I have implemented this feature. 3 seaweed strands made up of 10 ellipses.
(e) Seaweed animation (4 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Seaweed animation with seaweed swaying back and forth.
(f) Seaweed positioning (3 strands) (3 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. 3 strands made.
(g) Fish modeling: 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body, 2 tail fins, (6 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Fish modelled with 2 eyes with pupils using drawSphere. 1 body, 1 tail,
and 2 tail fins made using drawCone.
(h) Fish animation: The fish must swim in a circle around the seaweed. It should
always be aligned with the tangent of the circle. (4 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Fish swims around rock staying aligned with the tangent of the circle.
Fish moves up and down slightly and moves around the seaweed on the z-axis. Fish fins also move back and forth.
(i) A burst of 4-5 bubbles should appear every few seconds. (4 Marks).
I have implemented this feature but now in the best way. I struggled getting the bubbles to appear individually
after a period of time so they would appear in bursts. My bubbles appear rather close together.
(j) Each bubble should appear near the mouth of the character (2 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Bubbles appear near character mouth.
(k) The shape of each bubble should oscillate with time. (2 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Bubble shape oscillates with time.
(l) Each bubble should move straight up with time. (2 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Bubbles go straight up with time.
(m) Each bubble should be removed/deleted after approximately 12 seconds. (1
Mark).
I have implemented this feature though deletion is being done by moving the bubble back to a the character mouth.
I could not figure out how to actually delete objects so instead an old bubble is reused after 12 seconds.
(n) Model a human character with no arms. (4 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Character modelled with head, body and legs.
(o) The character should move in the x and y world directions. (2 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Character moves both up to down and left to right.
(p) The legs of the character should kick (hips, knees) as shown in the video. (4
Marks). The feet do not move.
I have implemented this feature. Characters legs move with feet staying fixed.
(q) You do not have to match the exact motion or dimensions of the objects shown in
the sample executable. However, your scene and the sample one should be
qualitatively and visually similar (4 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Scene modelled after sample scene.
(r) Programming style (comments, functions) (2 Marks).
I have implemented this feature. Used functions for more complicated models and commented code.
(s) The scene should be 512x512. [-2 Marks if it is not.]
I have made sure scene is 512x512.
(t) You have to submit a SINGLE file called <firstname-lastname>.zip (-2
Marks if you do not) that includes all the necessary files, unless the TA posts
different submission instructions.
I submitted a single file called Christopher-Lee.zip with all necessary files
(u) You nave to include a readme.txt file that describes in full detail which of the
required elements you have implemented successfully and which ones you
have not. [-4 if you do not].
This readme is included with submission.
